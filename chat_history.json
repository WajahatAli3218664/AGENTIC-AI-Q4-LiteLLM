These traits include chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, and external genitalia. Typically, individuals are assigned male or female at birth based on these characteristics.\n\n*   **Sexual activity:** This refers to behaviors involving physical contact with the intention of sexual arousal or reproduction. This can include intercourse, oral sex, mutual masturbation, and other forms of intimate contact.\n\n*   **Gender:** While related to sex, gender is a social construct encompassing roles, behaviors, expressions, and identities of individuals. It is distinct from biological sex.\n\nIt is important to note that sex and gender are complex and multifaceted concepts, and can vary across individuals and cultures."
